The dataset is downloaded from the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Each data is assigned to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activity_labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_tests <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
X_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
X_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

The training and test sets are merged to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Sub (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Combined (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Sub, Y and X using cbind() function

Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted.
Tidy (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Combined, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement


Data set is labeled with desriptive variable names.
code column in Tidy renamed into activities
Acc is replaced by Accelerometer in column’s name
Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope in column’s name
BodyBody is replaced by Body in column’s name
Mag is replaced by Magnitude in column’s name
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
final (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by summarizing Tidy taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
final is exported into final.txt file.
